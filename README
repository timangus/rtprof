rtprof - Real Time Profiler
---------------------------

Who? Tim Angus <tim@ngus.net>

What? A profiling tool that works in real time and provides a pretty 3D
visualisation of the profle.

Why? I dunno, seemed like a good idea at the time...

Where? Edinburgh University, for my undergraduate dissertation.

When? 2002-2003.

How?

  * Compile the client program with "-finstrument-functions -g" in CFLAGS and
    "-lrtprof" in LIBS.
  * Fire up "rtprof <client program binary>".
  * Execute "RTPROF_SKT=rtprof://localhost <client program>"
  * Move around the visualisation using keys W A S D, LSHIFT, LCTRL.
